# PS-ADUDisableReport
The script collects all users from within the search base on all domain controllers and then disables those beyond the specified threshold. 
It also allows for you to set a minimum account age to prevent new accounts being disbaled. 

It will then output the below CSV providing information about those accounts that were disabled previously as well as those that have never logged in.
